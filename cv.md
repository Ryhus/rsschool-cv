## Code Examples

**Linear regression in one line of code (Normal Equation)**:

```python
import numpy as np

X = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]])
y = np.array([5, 7, 9, 11])

X = np.c_[np.ones(X.shape[0]), X]

coeffs = np.linalg.inv(X.T.dot(X)).dot(X.T).dot(y) #  <== The magic is here

print("Coefficients:", coeffs)
```

## Experience

#### PLATA, MX Credit Systems (Ex Tinkoff Bank in Mexico)

**Role:** Collection Risk Analyst
**Period:** September 2023 – June 2024

- Worked with clients in delinquency, analyzed client data, and created and maintained Tableau dashboards for key
  collection metrics such as cure rate (percentage of clients who paid off delinquency) and client count in delinquency
- Collaborated with collection team to develop dashboards for monitoring collection metrics related to client contact
  rates with collection agents and created a motivation system for collection agents
- Conducted A/B tests with the team to explore new ideas aimed at improving the main collection metric—cure rate
- Maintained, and monitored automated collection messaging campaigns
- Created and maintained data marts using data from the Data Warehouse (DWH) with Snowflake

#### IPJSC Ingosstrakh, Moscow

**Role:** Data Scientist
**Period:** January 2019 - September 2022

- Developed three distinct scoring models for different segments in the auto-insurance market using machine learning
  methodologies. These models contributed to a significant reduction in annual net losses, achieving a reduction of
  12% - 25% in their respective segments
- Spearheaded a text analysis project focused on extracting relevant information from court cases in the
  auto-insurance industry, with a specific emphasis on identifying fraudulent cases. Leveraged natural language
  processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to automate the process, improving efficiency and accuracy
  in detecting fraudulent activities
- Worked on an experimental project called ”Early Prolongation”, aimed at offering clients contract extensions with
  discounts to reduce churn among high-value customers. The project resulted in a medium reduction in customer
  churn from ”good clients” segment
- Have been developing data marts and implemented feature engineering techniques to prepare datasets for machine
  learning modeling. This enabled the seamless integration of data into various ML models and enhanced predictive
  accuracy and performance
- Developed and maintained interactive dashboards for the retail department utilizing SQL and SAS Visual Analytics
  (SAS VA). These dashboards allowed stakeholders to visualize and analyze key performance indicators
- Conducted analysis for the retail department upon their request, providing valuable insights and recommendations
  to improve business operations and optimize sales strategies
